**Description**
Fall of 2022, I was in my mobile app development class and my professor mentioned research being done between the exercise science and computer science department, and that was my chance to combine my two degrees. So even though I had no experience, I took the leap and asked if I could get the research professor's contact info so that I could be a part of the research. By the end of spring 2023 semester, I had received 4 credits for the research and developed an app by myself to extract accelerometer data from a heart rate device, create a real-time accelerometer graph, and have it save collected data to dynamically created files. It was here that I discovered my passion to do research and that I had confirmed the path for me that I had developed on a word document freshman year, where I would end up declaring my dual degree of a B.S. in Computer Science with a Cybersecurity concentration and a B.S. in Exercise Science. Going with my gut in 2020-2021 paid off as this research confirmed I wanted to pursue my passion of technology in the hope that I would use it to help positively impact the health of patients.
