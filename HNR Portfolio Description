Artifact: most proud of

***Description***
Fall of 2022, I was in my mobile app development class and my professor mentioned research being done between the exercise science and computer science 
department, and that was my chance to combine my two degrees. So even though I had no experience, I took the leap and asked if I could get the research 
professor's contact info so that I could be a part of the research. By the end of spring 2023 semester, I had received 4 credits for the research and 
developed an app by myself that extracts accelerometer data from the Polar Verity medical device, create a real-time graph, and insert data into dynamically 
generated files. This app is the basis for conducting the rest of this research where data will be collected and analyzed to help coaches prepare recovery 
and rest guidelines for baseball pitchers so to reduce shoulder injury. It was here that I discovered my passion to do research and that I had confirmed 
the path for me, where I want to combine my dual degree of a B.S. in Computer Science with a Cybersecurity concentration and a B.S. in Exercise Science. 





***Reflection and self-development***
Going with my gut in 2020-2021 paid off as this research confirmed I wanted to pursue my passion of technology in the hope that I would 
use it to help positively impact the health of patients. Learning polar opposite languages of technology and medicine and applying it into my research 
of mobile app development to aid in reducing shoulder injury risk has provided me a new perspective on technology and medicine. These experiences 
demonstrate my uniqueness of valuing medical knowledge and implementing it into technology, not to replace doctors, but as a tool to help ensure the 
health and longevity of peopleâ€™s lives. 

When I brought my parents to meet the professor who guided my reserach, Dr. Pexa, we were in the Biomechanics lab and he stated how he was a bit nervous
bringing me on becasue he did not know what I would be able to accomplish, and I won't lie, neither did I. Originally, when I started the research back in 
August 2022, I was as a novice to Android Studio. However, I took on the challenge only one month later. When first looking at the GitHub with all the 
source code, I questioned as to what I had gotten myself into. I built the foundation of the app with software I barely knew and a language I did not 
know existed, Kotlin, while being the lone tech wolf in the lab. Currently continuing this research in my spare time, future plans include adding a machine 
learning component and implementing the research for other over-hand sports, which is the field of computer science I desire to go into. As a bonus, in 
May 2023, it was confirmed that my name would appear on the research when it goes for publication, and that this is only the beginning.
